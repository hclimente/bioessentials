Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide.

Very heterogeneous.

Clinical decisions are based on the expression of 3 markers: the expression of the endocrine receptors for estrogen and progesterone (ER and PgR, respectively) and the aberrant expression of HER2. All of them are targets for chemotherapy.

# Triple-negative breast cancer

Those patients that lack the expression of all ER, PgR and HER2 are called triple-negative (TNBC). These patients present a worse prognosis than the rest, due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and the lack of a clear molecular target. Still, the main treatment is chemotherapy.

# Familial breast cancer

A French doctor, Pierre Paul Broca, reported in the mid-19th century the first case of familial breast cancer. Indeed, his wife acquired breast cancer, as many women in her family had for, at least, 4 generations. However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that two genes involved in DNA reparation were associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Some mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of developing breast cancer, giving a 57–65% or 45–55% risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 years among women.

However, while approximately 5–10% of all patients with breast cancer exhibit a monogenic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, only ~25% of them harbor BRCA1/2 mutations. Other 23 genes have been associated with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer. Most of them are in pathways connected to genome maintenance and, in consequence, to BRCA1 and BRCA2.

## Involved genes

Nearly all known HBOC susceptibility genes encode tumor suppressors that participate in genome stability pathways:

* Homologous recombination repair (HRR): it's a pathway that involves BRCA1, BRCA2 and actually, most of the HBOC genes. It deals with double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by using the undamaged chromosome as template for error-free repair. After a DSB occurs, the MRN complex detects and binds the free DNA ends. Then, it promotes
* associated


## GENESIS

GENESIS (GENE SISter) is a French project that aims to shed some light into familial breast cancer. Specifically, it focuses on patients that do not show  BRCA1/2 mutations.
