# Cancer

Cancer is the name a collection of related diseases receive: all cancers undergo an uncontrolled proliferation of the patient cells, which spread into surrounding tissues. In a normal organism, cells grow and divide to maintain the tissue. As cells grow old, or accumulate too much damage, they undergo cell death and new cells will take their place. However in cancer this orderly process breaks down. Cells refuse to die when they get old, or  accumulate damage. New cells are formed even if they are not needed. In consequence they form purpose-less growths called tumors.

Cancer is a genetic disease. By altering crucial genes, cells develop an abnormal behavior. These alterations can be inherited from our parents, or acquired during our lifetime, due to replication errors or exposure to DNA-damaging substances. As with any other phenotypic trait, the likelihood of developing cancer will be determined by the interplay between our genetic background and the environment: genetic backgrounds may favor or difficult the acquisition of mutations, in the same way environments can.

# Breast cancer

Breast cancer involves the uncontrolled proliferation of breast cells. In most of the cases they begin in the ducts that carry the milk to the nipple. The tumor can originate in other tissues, mainly the milk-producing gland.

Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women, after nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths after lung cancer. It is mostly a women's disease: only about 1% of the diagnosed cases are in men. Among the most important risk factors for breast cancer we can highlight age, family history, reproductive history, usage of oral contraceptives and exposure to radiation. Most breast cancers occur after age 50 years.

# Breast cancer subtypes

Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease. In general, clinical decisions are based on the expression of 3 molecular markers: the expression of the endocrine receptors for estrogen and progesterone (ER and PgR, respectively) and the aberrant expression of HER2. All of those proteins are targets for chemotherapy. Based on the results, we distinguish three main breast cancer subtypes: hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive and triple negative.

## Hormone receptor positive

Includes the tumors expressing ER and PR, which may depend on estrogen and/or progesterone to grow. They happen specially in postmenopausal women. HR+/HER2- aka LuminalA are the majority of breast cancers (60-75%) and they present the best prognosis.

## HER2 positive

Those tumors depend on the protein HER2/neu (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) to proliferate, which they over-express. HR+/HER2+ aka LuminalB constitutes 10% of the cases, while HR-/HER2 aka HER2-enriched involve 5% of them. There are a couple of very effective drugs against it.

## Triple-negative

Those patients that lack the expression of all ER, PgR and HER2 are called triple-negative (TNBC). These patients present a worse prognosis than the rest, due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and the lack of a clear molecular target. Still, the main treatment is chemotherapy.
