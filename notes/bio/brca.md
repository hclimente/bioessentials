*Introduction to breast cancer, with special focus on the familial breast cancer, whose study is one of the topics of my PhD project.*

Among woman, breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, after nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths after lung cancer. It is mostly a women's disease: only about 1% of the diagnosed cases are in men.

Among the most important risk factors for breast cancer we can highlight age, family history, reproductive history, usage of oral contraceptives and exposure to radiation. Most breast cancers occur after age 50 years.

# Breast cancer subtypes

Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease. In general, clinical decisions are based on the expression of 3 markers: the expression of the endocrine receptors for estrogen and progesterone (ER and PgR, respectively) and the aberrant expression of HER2. All of those proteins are targets for chemotherapy. Based on the results, we distinguish three main breast cancer subtypes: hormone receptor positive, HER2 positive and triple negative.

## Hormone receptor positive

Includes the tumors expressing ER and PR, which may depend on estrogen and/or progesterone to grow. They happen specially in postmenopausal women. HR+/HER2- aka LuminalA are the majority of breast cancers (60-75%) and they present the best prognosis.

## HER2 positive

Those tumors depend on the protein HER2/neu (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) to proliferate, which they over-express. HR+/HER2+ aka LuminalB constitutes 10% of the cases, while HR-/HER2 aka HER2-enriched involve 5% of them. There are a couple of very effective drugs against it.

## Triple-negative

Those patients that lack the expression of all ER, PgR and HER2 are called triple-negative (TNBC). These patients present a worse prognosis than the rest, due to the aggressiveness of the tumor and the lack of a clear molecular target. Still, the main treatment is chemotherapy.

# Familial breast cancer

A French doctor, Pierre Paul Broca, reported in the mid-19th century the first case of familial breast cancer. Indeed, his wife acquired breast cancer, as many women in her family had for, at least, 4 generations. However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that two genes involved in DNA reparation, *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* were associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The relative risk conferred by a the presence of multiple breast cancers in the family was estimated in 2.7.

## Involved genes

HBOC follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Some mutations in *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* increase the risk of developing breast cancer, giving a 57–65% or 45–55% risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 years among women. Moreover, they exhibit a higher likelihood of acquiring triple-negative breast cancer.

While approximately 5–10% of all patients with breast cancer exhibit a monogenic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, only ~25% of them harbor *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* mutations. Other 23 genes have been associated with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer. Most of them are in pathways connected to genome maintenance and, in consequence, to *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*. Nearly all known HBOC susceptibility genes encode tumor suppressors that participate in genome stability pathways:

* Homologous recombination repair (HRR): it's a pathway that involves *BRCA1*, *BRCA2* and actually, most of the HBOC genes. It deals with double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by using the undamaged chromosome as template for error-free repair. After a DSB occurs, the MRN complex detects and binds the free DNA ends. Then, it promotes
* Replication fork stability.
* Transcription–replication collisions.
* Mismatch repair.
* DNA damage signaling, checkpoints and cell death.

## GENESIS

GENESIS (GENE SISter) is a French project that aims to shed some light into familial breast cancer. Specifically, it focuses on patients that do not show *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* mutations.
