# Familial breast cancer

A French doctor, Pierre Paul Broca, reported in the mid-19th century the first case of familial breast cancer. Indeed, his wife acquired breast cancer, as many women in her family had for, at least, 4 generations. However, it wasn't until the late 20th century that two genes involved in DNA reparation, BRCA1 and BRCA2 were associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The relative risk conferred by a the presence of multiple breast cancers in the family was estimated in 2.7.

# Involved genes

HBOC follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Some mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of developing breast cancer, giving a 57–65% or 45–55% risk of developing breast cancer by age 70 years among women. Moreover, they exhibit a higher likelihood of acquiring triple-negative breast cancer.

While approximately 5–10% of all patients with breast cancer exhibit a monogenic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, only ~25% of them harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Other 23 genes have been associated with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer (Table 1).

## Function

Most of the HBOC genes are in pathways connected to genome maintenance and, in consequence, to BRCA1 and BRCA2. Nearly all known HBOC susceptibility genes encode tumor suppressors that participate in genome stability pathways: homologous recombination repair, replication fork stability, transcription–replication collisions, mismatch repair, and DNA damage signaling, checkpoints and cell death.

### Homologous recombination repair

Homologous recombination repair pathway (HRR) deals with double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by using the undamaged chromosome as template for error-free repair. It  After a DSB occurs, the MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50 and NDN) detects and binds the free DNA ends. Then, it promotes DNA damage checkpoint signaling.

HRR involves BRCA1, BRCA2 and actually, most of the HBOC genes. Regarding BRCA1, it's hypothesized that acts as a recruitment scaffold, due to it's ability to interact with a wide range of proteins. A deficiency of BRCA1 is linked to the inability to trigger HRR. Mutations in the MRN complex have also been clinically associated to breast cancer, although dubiously so in the case of RAD50 variants. Reassuringly, some other HBOC genes are interactors of MRN complex, BRCA1 or BRCA2.

### Replication fork stability

BRCA1 and BRCA2 protect newly synthesized DNA and promote restart of stalled forks in an HRR-independent manner. In the absence of these proteins, newly synthesized DNA in a stalled fork would get degraded, leading to genome instability and increasing the risk of cancer.

### Transcription–replication collisions

Collisions between transcription and replication are emerging as a source of genome instability. Particularly RNA-DNA hybrids called R-loops can form between the nascent transcript and the DNA template. They can lead to double-strand breaks and mutations. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 participate in the resolution of R-loops, preventing their accumulation. In consequence, BRCA-deficient cells tend to suffer transcriptional stress that leads to genome instability. Nonetheless the relationship between this mechanism and proneness to HBOC is yet to be proven, and the genes involved further investigated.

### Mismatch repair

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) corrects base-base mispairs. When MMR is faulty, accumulations point mutations and genetic changes in repeated nucleotide sequences (microsatellite instability) occur. MMR also plays a role in error-free HRR.

### DNA damage signaling, checkpoints and cell death

Pathways involved in genome maintenance, cell cycle checkpoints and cell death usually eliminate cells with damaged DNA. When proteins involved in them are not active, some processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence will not occur. In consequence, cells that undergo genomic alterations are allowed to proliferate. The most famous case of HBOC in this pathway is TP53, which coordinates the transcriptional induction of many genome stability factors.

GENESIS (GENE SISter) is a French project that aims to shed some light into familial breast cancer. Specifically, it focuses on patients that do not show BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
