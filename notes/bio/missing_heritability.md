The heritability is the phenotypic variance in a population that is attributable to additive genetic factors.

It is estimated in twin studies.

# The problem

Take height. Height is a considered a 'model' trait for quantitative genetics due to it's ease of measurement. It's heritability was assessed more than a century ago, when Galton and Fisher observed a pattern of family resemblance, consistent with a polygenic additive model of inheritance. Actually we estimate an heritability of ~0.8, that is, 80% of the intra-population variability is due to genetic factors. Three studies with a total sample size of ∼63k individuals (14k + 16k + 34k) identified 54 variants that are reliably associated with height. **COMMENTS ON low variability found**

Moreover, there is an alarming low overlap between the causal SNPs identified in the different studies. There are two reasons for this. First, we are dealing with SNPs that have a very limited effect size (% of variation explained). In consequence, we need sample sizes of the order of tens of thousands to reliably identify one causal SNP. Second, we are conducting the hundreds of thousands of association tests. Thus, we need to be very stringent with the significant threshold in order to minimize type I errors (false positives).

# Proposed causes

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the missing heritability problem. Some of them are: low n, high p; rare SNPs; epigenetics; epistasis.
